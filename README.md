# Auto-RC-Car

This is my MSc Artificial Intelligence project.

This readme file is to be updated and refined.



## To do next
- [ ] Add and use multithreading for the sensor server.
- [ ] Add and use multithreading for the controller server.


## File structure explained

```main.py``` is the executable for this project. It combines everything together.

```/servers```, a directory for the server files for the camera, sensor, and controller connections between the computer and the Pi.
