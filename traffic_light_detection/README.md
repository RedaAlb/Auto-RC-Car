# The traffic light detection directory

This directory contains all the needed files to allow for traffic light detection.

`tl_cascade.xml`, is a trained Haar cascade detector, which is used to detect traffic lights in the frame.

`traffic_light_detector.py`, performs the detection and detects which light is on, red or green.
