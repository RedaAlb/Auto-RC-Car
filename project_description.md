# Project description (to be updated)

There are many autonomous RC car projects, however, there are currently no readily accessible, practical, and comprehensive development
of autonomous RC cars to upstage this interest. All of the current projects have common goals, avoid obstacles and stay in lane.
Most of them have very little interaction with the real world, are very limited to the environment they are put in and have a very
fixed setting. Furthermore, they require lots of physical space to operate. If a complex road system was to be implemented with multiple
traffic signs and interactions, it would take up a big space making it very impractical to replicate scenarios in the real world.
The autonomous RC cars are developed to tackle only a few specific scenarios, which is not the case when it comes to real-life driving.
We face different situations constantly and we need to adapt to the changes and make the correct decisions to remain safe throughout our
journey.

The core objective of this project is to start the development of a comprehensive and expansive autonomous RC car model, by creating a
working model where the car can detect and overcome many different scenarios that are as close as possible to real-life; in terms of
adaptability and decision making while moving towards its destination.

I will be tackling this by developing a complete and comprehensive autonomous RC car, that can be placed in many different situations
and can make its own decisions by observing its environment constantly using a camera feed and a distance sensor. The environment for
the car is a miniature road system with intersections, different obstacles, and interactions that can be physically re-positioned to
create indefinite number of scenarios for the car to detect, comprehend, and tackle. The obstacles and interactions include traffic
lights, pedestrians (an obstruction in front), speed limit signs, left, right, forward signs, and many more. The car must successfully
and safely navigate through the road following the signs while interacting with all the obstacles and interactions it encounters and
staying in lane. The more interactions added the more realistic the environment will be. The turning signs can be said to represent a
GPS system, where the turns at intersections are determined by physically placed signs.
